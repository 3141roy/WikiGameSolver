## WikiGameSolver

This project involves the use of Breadth First Search Algorithm to solve the famous Wiki Game

### About

Wiki Game is a famous competitive game which involves going from a link A to another link B in the fewest possible clicks.

Since we need the shortest path, we will implement the Breadth First Search algorithm 

#### Scope of improvement

Since we are using BFS and visiting every single node it takes a lot of time, we can implement better algorithms and apply machine learning techniques like A* to improve the time required
